# Introduction

## **Welcome**

Our project arouse out of Information Technology Services desire for a student focused automated help and support application. With limited resources and staffing constraints, ITS is expected to provide fast and efficient technical support to the universities diverse community of students, faculty, and staff. This task is compounded by the vast number of products and services deployed across campus, necessitating considerable investments into training for Service Desk employees. Add to those problems our Universities labyrinthian website, which is maintained by more than 450 people across campus, you soon realize the value a virtual assistant may add. By creating an intuitive and high quality virtual assistant, our hope is that we can alleviate some of the burden on ITS Service Desk staff and provide the SU community with technical support available 24/7. Our goal is to create an application that is maintainable and extensible, as we envision the future where our virtual assistant will be able to create new opportunities for the university to engage with the community on topics like recruitment, admissions, registration, academics, student affairs, alumni services, and career services.
